# Christian-Kevin-Organizer

This application is meant to be an ORGANIZER for busy college students with many things on their to do list.
The idea is that the program will sweep through various applications (Moodle, Outlook, Gmail) and their calendars to create a to do list.
However, the schedule item it takes in from moodle will be evaluated based on the difficulty and extent of the task and put on your schedule accordingly.
The program should evaluate how much time there is left until each individual deadline and plan accordingly its preparation, execution and reviewing stages.
There should also be recommendations for quizzes/tests on what sources to consult for practice and theory.
Essentially a to-do list that develops itself over the coming day, week, and month.
There should also be a yearly goals section to give the user the means to achieve milestones set by them, or suggested by the program.
Suggestions could be concrete steps towards abstract goals (ie: if the user has as a goal to be healthy, the program can suggest nearby gyms every so often, and foods to buy).
